# WindOS - The Batch + Powershell OS
WindOS is a open-source operating system that can run with no install not counting downloading the ZIP. WindOS is made using the interperted programming languages Batch Powershell, and VBScript. WindOS has files from MoonOS and New OS combined and cleaned with more to come. (GITHUB SAYS THE FILES ARE 100% BATCHFILE BECAUSE THE POWERSHELL IS INSIDE THE .BAT FILES.)
